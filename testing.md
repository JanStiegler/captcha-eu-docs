# Testing

To ensure that integration tests continue to work while using the captcha.eu protection, you have multiple options.

## Self-Made

You can detect the unit, integration, or automation test yourself and ignore the response of the validation endpoint (or completely skip the call).

## Bypass Key

You can obtain a special "Bypass" key in the dashboard. If you supply the Bypass key as a solution in the verification call, the call will always succeed.

> Note that this still counts as a call.
