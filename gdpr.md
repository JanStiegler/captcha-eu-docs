  - behavioral data is anonmized on the client side already
  - IP / Connection data is stored anonmized by removing the last 2 blocks
    - e.g: `8.8.8.8` is stored (for statistics/ml...) as `8.8` same for ipv6 (`2001:db8:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888` -> `2001:db8:3333:4444:5555:6666`
    
# Detecting/Classfing bots

to detect and classify bots we use various layers some of them are - only anonmized values are stored:

  - client side browser classification
  - behavioral: mouse movement, keyboard timings
  - system: timing of different parts
  - machine learning to generate a likelhood-to-be-human score.
