## What is a 	ðŸ¤–

a bot in short is a automated process which submits your forms or executes actions.
the goal of the bot might be:
  - DDos [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack)
  - Enhance chances of winning (Sweapstakes)
  - Manipulate data (Polls)
  - Search Engines / Crawlers
The range of bot technics varies alot, some are just simple scripts and on the other end of the spectrum you have high sophisticated
bots that try their best to be not deteced and act as close as humans.

Search Engine Bots are the exception, they are generally considered "good" bots - but still are bots
